# PowerBI
This repository encompasses all the power BI projects that I have curated. 

First project: Inventory Management
Every organization in every sector has to arrange for and maintain sorts of inventories at its disposal to help them run their operations smoothly. The informed inventory decisions help the organisations to deal with any unforeseen events like delay in the supply, sudden increase in the customer demands, labor strikes and so on. This makes the maintainence of the inventory, a primary and significant task that should be dealt with utter care and maintained on regular intervals.
